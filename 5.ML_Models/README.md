1) `Baseline` folder - It contains the notebooks for all the ML models (classifiers) implemented for the project:
	* XGBoost : Owner [Nancy Saxena](https://github.com/NancyS1)
	* Random Forest : Owner [Divya Khandelwal](https://github.com/divyaKh)
	* Decision Tree : Owner [Wen-Hao Tseng](https://github.com/Wenhao-Tseng)
	* Gradient Boost : Owner [Chintan Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chintan-shah64)
 
 The following are the key concepts in these notebooks:
 * `Cross validation` is implemented
 * `HyperParamter Tuning` is done (wherever required)
 * Models are run with different pre-processed data
 * Models are studied using F1-score, accuracy, Confusion Matrix 

2) The `final_notebook` contains all the important steps from the project lifecycle (data science lifecycle). It is an compilation of code that has been implemented in all other folders combined. Note: It might not cover everything, but it directs to parent notebook wherever required. In this,  `CROSS VALIDATION` is not applied on the ML models.
