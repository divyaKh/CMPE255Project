# Project title: 

Fake news detection

## What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?

We will be using LIAR dataset for project.

The url to LIAR dataset is:
https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip


## Description of the problem you’ll solve or the question you’ll investigate.

Fake news is false information that is broacasted to the people. It has immense impact on the society.Through this dataset we will be creating a model to detect the news is fake or real. We will use classification alogorithm for this model. The model will be able to predict if the news is real or fake by labelling it.


## Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data).

The datasets will be analysed and cleaned using a python script. For the model any classification algorithms can be used. However, we are considering Decison trees. 

## How will you measure success?

The success will be measured from accuracy score of the model. However we will also consider confusion matrix which lets us know about the False Positives and False negatives.
