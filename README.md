All the datasets will be analysed and combined, if possible.

## Description of the problem you’ll solve or the question you’ll investigate.

Fake news is false information that is broacasted to the people. It has immense impact on the society.Through this dataset we will be creating a model to detect the news is fake or real. We will use classification alogorithm for this model. The model will be able to predict if the news is real or fake by labelling it.
