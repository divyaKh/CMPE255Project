# Project title: 

Fake news detection

## What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?

The data is present in form of various links under this repository.
https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Repository_of_fake_news_detection_datasets/14151755
We will take multiple sets of data from various sources mentioned in the repository specially LIAR and FEVER for the project.

However the link to LIAR is not working accoridng to this repository. The url to LIAR dataset is:
https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip

All the datasets will be analysed and combined, if possible.

## Description of the problem you’ll solve or the question you’ll investigate.

Fake news is false information that is broacasted to the people. It has immense impact on the society.Through this dataset we will be creating a model to detect the news is fake or real. We will use classification alogorithm for this model. The model will be able to predict if the news is real or fake by labelling it.


## Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data).

The datasets will be analysed and will be combined using a python script. Once the dataset is ready, we will split the data into training, validation and testing sets. For the model any classification algorithms can be used. However, we are condidering Decison tree classification.

## How will you measure success?

The success will be measured from accuracy score of the model. However we will also consider confusion matrix which lets us know about the False Positives and False negatives.
